"   ^5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night: and"
"   the evening and the morning were the first day."
"   ^6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,"
"   and let it divide the waters from the waters."
"   ^7And God made the firmament; and divided the waters which were under"
"   the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it"
"   was so."
"   ^8And God called the firmament Heaven: and the evening and the morning"
"   were the second day."
"   ^9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered into one"
"   place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so."
"   ^10And God called the dry land Earth, and the collection of waters he"
"   called Seas: and God saw that it was good."
"   ^11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding"
"   seed, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit after its kind, whose seed is"
"   in itself, upon the earth: and it was so."
"   ^12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after its"
"   kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after its"
"   kind: and God saw that it was good."
"   ^13And the evening and the morning were the third day."
"   ^14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to"
"   divide the day from the night: and let them be for signs, and for"
"   seasons, and for days, and years."
"   ^15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven, to give"
"   light upon the earth: and it was so."
"   ^16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,"
"   and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also."
"   ^17And God set them in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon"
"   the earth."
"   ^18And to rule over the day, and over the night, and to divide the"
"   light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good."
"   ^19And the evening and the morning were the fourth day."
"   ^20And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving"
"   creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the"
"   open firmament of heaven."
"   ^21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth,"
"   which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind, and every"
"   winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good."
"   ^22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill"
"   the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth."
"   ^23And the evening and the morning were the fifth day."
"   ^24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after"
"   his kind, cattle, and the creeping animal, and the beast of the earth"
"   after his kind: and it was so."
"   ^25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after"
"   their kind, and every animal that creepeth upon the earth after his"
"   kind: and God saw that it was good."
"   ^26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and"
"   let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of"
"   the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every"
"   creeping animal that creepeth upon the earth."
"   ^27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he"
"   him; male and female created he them."
"   ^28And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and"
"   multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion"
"   over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every"
"   living animal that moveth upon the earth."
"   ^29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,"
"   which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is"
"   the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food."
"   ^30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and"
"   to every animal that creepeth upon the earth, in which is life, I have"
"   given every green herb for food: and it was so."
"   ^31And God saw every thing that he had made, and behold, it was very"
"   good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day."

"   ^1Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of"
"   them."
"   ^2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he"
"   rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made."
"   ^3And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in"
"   it he had rested from all his work which God created and made."
"   ^4These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they"
"   were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the"
"   heavens."
"   ^5And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every"
"   herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to"
"   rain on the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground."
"   ^6But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face"
"   of the ground."
"   ^7And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed"
"   into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."
"   ^8And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put"
"   the man whom he had formed."
"   ^9And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is"
"   pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the"
"   midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil."
"   ^10And a river went out of Eden to water the garden: and from thence it"
"   was parted, and became into four heads."
"   ^11The name of the first is Pison, which compasseth the whole land of"
"   Havilah, where there is gold;"
"   ^12And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the"
"   onyx-stone."
"   ^13And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same that compasseth"
"   the whole land of Cush."
"   ^14And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: which floweth toward"
"   the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates."
"   ^15And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden,"
"   to dress it, and to keep it."
"   ^16And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the"
"   garden thou mayest freely eat:"
"   ^17But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not"
"   eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt surely die."
"   ^18And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone:"
"   I will make him a help meet for him."
"   ^19And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field,"
"   and every fowl of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he"
"   would call them; and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that"
"   was its name."
"   ^20And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowls of the air, and"
"   to every beast of the field: but for Adam there was not found a help"
"   meet for him."
"   ^21And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he"
"   slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its"
"   place."
"   ^22And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, he made woman,"
"   and brought her to the man."
"   ^23And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh:"
"   she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man."
"   ^24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall"
"   cleave to his wife: and they shall be one flesh."
"   ^25And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not"
"   ashamed."

"   ^1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the"
"   LORD God had made: and he said to the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye"
"   shall not eat of every tree of the garden?"
"   ^2And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the"
"   trees of the garden:"
"   ^3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God"
"   hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye"
"   die."
"   ^4And the serpent said to the woman, Ye shall not surely die:"
"   ^5For God doth know, that in the day ye eat of it, then your eyes shall"
"   be opened: and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."
"   ^6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it"
"   was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise;"
"   she took of its fruit, and ate, and gave also to her husband with her,"
"   and he ate."
"   ^7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were"
"   naked: and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made for themselves"
"   aprons."
"   ^8And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the"
"   cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence"
"   of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden."
"   ^9And the LORD God called to Adam, and said to him, Where art thou?"
"   ^10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden: and I was afraid,"
"   because I was naked; and I hid myself."
"   ^11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of"
"   the tree of which I commanded thee, that thou shouldest not eat?"
"   ^12And the man said, The woman, whom thou gavest to be with me, she"
"   gave me of the tree, and I ate."
"   ^13And the LORD God said to the woman, What is this that thou hast"
"   done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I ate."
"   ^14And the LORD God said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this,"
"   thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field:"
"   upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of"
"   thy life:"
"   ^15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy"
"   seed and her seed: it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his"
"   heel."
"   ^16To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy"
"   conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children: and thy desire"
"   shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."
"   ^17And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy"
"   wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying,"
"   Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow"
"   shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;"
"   ^18Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou"
"   shalt eat the herb of the field;"
"   ^19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou shalt"
"   return to the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art,"
"   and to dust shalt thou return."
"   ^20And Adam called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of"
"   all living."
"   ^21For Adam also and for his wife the LORD God made coats of skins, and"
"   clothed them."
"   ^22And the LORD God said, Behold, the man hath become as one of us, to"
"   know good and evil. And now, lest he should put forth his hand, and"
"   take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:"
"   ^23Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to"
"   till the ground from which he was taken."
"   ^24So he drove out the man: and he placed at the east of the garden of"
"   Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the"
"   way of the tree of life."

"   ^1And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and"
"   said, I have gotten a man from the LORD."
"   ^2And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep,"
"   but Cain was a tiller of the ground."
"   ^3And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the"
"   fruit of the ground an offering to the LORD."
"   ^4And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the"
"   fat thereof. And the LORD had respect to Abel, and to his offering:"
"   ^5But to Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very"
"   wroth, and his countenance fell."
"   ^6And the LORD said to Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy"
"   countenance fallen?"
"   ^7If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not"
"   well, sin lieth at the door. And to thee shall be his desire, and thou"
"   shalt rule over him."
"   ^8And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass when they"
"   were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew"
"   him."
"   ^9And the LORD said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I"
"   know not: Am I my brother's keeper?"
"   ^10And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood"
"   crieth to me from the ground."
"   ^11And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth"
"   to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;"
"   ^12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield to thee"
"   its strength: A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth."
"   ^13And Cain said to the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear."
"   ^14Behold, thou hast driven me this day from the face of the earth; and"
"   from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond"
"   in the earth; and it will come to pass, that every one that findeth me"
"   will slay me."
"   ^15And the LORD said to him, Therefore whoever slayeth Cain, vengeance"
"   shall be taken on him seven-fold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain,"
"   lest any finding him should kill him."
"   ^16And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the"
"   land of Nod, on the east of Eden."
"   ^17And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bore Enoch: and he"
"   built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his"
"   son Enoch."
"   ^18And to Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael"
"   begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech."
"   ^19And Lamech took to him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and"
"   the name of the other Zillah."
"   ^20And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents,"
"   and of such as have cattle."
"   ^21And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as"
"   handle the harp and organ."
"   ^22And Zillah, she also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every"
"   artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah."
"   ^23And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye"
"   wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man to my"
"   wounding, and a young man to my hurt."
"   ^24If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold, truly Lamech seventy and"
"   seven-fold."
"   ^25And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his"
"   name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of"
"   Abel, whom Cain slew."
"   ^26And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his"
"   name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD."

"   ^4And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of"
"   the month, upon the mountains of Ararat."
"   ^5And the waters decreased continually, till the tenth month: in the"
"   tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the"
"   mountains seen."
"   ^6And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the"
"   window of the ark which he had made:"
"   ^7And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, till the"
"   waters were dried from off the earth."
"   ^8Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated"
"   from off the face of the ground;"
"   ^9But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned"
"   to him into the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole"
"   earth. Then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in to"
"   him into the ark."
"   ^10And he stayed yet other seven days, and again he sent forth the dove"
"   out of the ark;"
"   ^11And the dove came in to him in the evening, and lo, in her mouth was"
"   an olive-leaf plucked off: So Noah knew that the waters were abated"
"   from off the earth."
"   ^12And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; which"
"   returned not again to him any more."
"   ^13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the"
"   first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried from off"
"   the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and"
"   behold, the face of the ground was dry."
"   ^14And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the"
"   month, was the earth dried."
"   ^15And God spoke to Noah, saying,"
"   ^16Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy"
"   sons' wives with thee."
"   ^17Bring forth with thee every living animal that is with thee, of all"
"   flesh, of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping animal that"
"   creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly on the earth,"
"   and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth."
"   ^18And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives"
"   with him:"
"   ^19Every beast, every creeping animal, and every fowl, and whatsoever"
"   creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went out of the ark."
"   ^20And Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean beast,"
"   and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar."
"   ^21And the LORD smelled a sweet savor; and the LORD said in his heart,"
"   I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the"
"   imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth: neither will I again"
"   smite any more every living animal as I have done."
"   ^22While the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat,"
"   and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."

"   ^1And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, Be fruitful, and"
"   multiply, and replenish the earth."
"   ^2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of"
"   the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth on the"
"   earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they"
"   delivered."
"   ^3Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; even as the"
"   green herb have I given you all things:"
"   ^4But flesh with the life of it, which is its blood, shall ye not eat."
"   ^5And surely your blood of your lives will I require: at the hand of"
"   every beast will I require it: and at the hand of man, at the hand of"
"   every man's brother will I require the life of man."
"   ^6Whoever sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in"
"   the image of God made he man."
"   ^7And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply, bring forth abundantly in the"

"   ^8And God spoke to Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,"

"   ^11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh"
"   be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any"
"   more be a flood to destroy the earth."
"   ^12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between"
"   me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual"
"   generations."
"   ^13I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a"
"   covenant between me and the earth."
"   ^14And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that"
"   the bow shall be seen in the cloud:"
"   ^15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and"
"   every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become"
"   a flood to destroy all flesh."
"   ^16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I"
"   may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living"
"   creature of all flesh that is upon the earth."
"   ^17And God said to Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have"
"   established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth."
"   ^18And the sons of Noah that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and"
"   Ham, and Japheth: and Ham was the father of Canaan."
"   ^19These three were the sons of Noah: and from them was the whole earth"
"   overspread."
"   ^20And Noah began to be a husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:"
"   ^21And he drank the wine, and was drunken, and he was uncovered within"
"   his tent."
"   ^22And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and"

"   ^23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their"
"   shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their"
"   father: and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's"
"   nakedness."
"   ^24And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done"
"   to him."
"   ^25And he said, Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he be to"
"   his brethren."
"   ^26And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be"
"   his servant."
"   ^27God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem;"

"   ^1Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah; Shem, Ham, and"

"   ^11Out of that land went forth Ashur, and built Nineveh, and the city"

"   ^15And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth,"

"   ^1And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech."
"   ^2And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east, that they found"
"   a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there."
"   ^3And they said one to another, come, let us make brick, and burn them"
"   thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for"
"   mortar."
"   ^4And they said, come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top"
"   may reach to heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we should be"
"   scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth."
"   ^5And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the"
"   children of men were building."
"   ^6And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one"
"   language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained"
"   from them, which they have imagined to do."
"   ^7Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they"
"   may not understand one another's speech."
"   ^8So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all"
"   the earth: and they left off to build the city."
"   ^9Therefore is the name of it called Babel, because the LORD there"
"   confounded the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD"
"   scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth."
"   ^10These are the generations of Shem: Shem was a hundred years old, and"
"   begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:"
"   ^11And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat"
"   sons and daughters."
"   ^12And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah."
"   ^13And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three"

"   ^14And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:"
"   ^15And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years,"
"   and begat sons and daughters."
"   ^16And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:"
"   ^17And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years,"
"   and begat sons and daughters."
"   ^18And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:"
"   ^19And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and"

"   ^28And Haran died before his father Terah, in the land of his nativity,"

"   father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah."
"   ^30But Sarai was barren; she had no child."
"   ^31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's"
"   son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went"
"   forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan;"

"   ^1Now the LORD had said to Abram, Depart from thy country, and from thy"

"   ^2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and"
"   make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:"
"   ^3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth"

"   ^4So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken to him, and Lot went with"

"   Haran."
"   ^5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all"
"   their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had"
"   gotten in Haran; and they went to go forth into the land of Canaan; and"
"   into the land of Canaan they came."
"   ^6And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the"
"   plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land."
"   ^7And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To thy seed will I give"
"   this land: and there he erected an altar to the LORD, who appeared to"
"   him."
"   ^8And he removed from thence to a mountain on the east of Beth-el, and"
"   pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Hai on the east: and"
"   there he erected an altar to the LORD, and called upon the name of the"
"   LORD."
"   ^9And Abram journeyed, going on still towards the south."
"   ^10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt"
"   to dwell there; for the famine was grievous in the land."
"   ^11And it came to pass, when he had come near to enter into Egypt, that"
"   he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair"
"   woman to look upon:"
"   ^12Therefore it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee,"
"   that they will say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they"
"   will save thee alive."
"   ^13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me"
"   for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee."
"   ^14And it came to pass, that when Abram had come into Egypt, the"
"   Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair."
"   ^15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before"
"   Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house."
"   ^16And he treated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen,"
"   and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and"
"   camels."
"   ^17And the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues,"
"   because of Sarai, Abram's wife."
"   ^18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done"
"   to me? why didst thou not tell me that she is thy wife?"
"   ^19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me"
"   for a wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way."
"   ^20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him"
"   away, and his wife, and all that he had."

"   ^1And Abram returned from Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had,"
"   and Lot with him, into the south."
"   ^2And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold."
"   ^3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth-el, to the"
"   place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and"
"   Hai;"
"   ^4To the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and"
"   there Abram called on the name of the LORD."
"   ^5And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents."
"   ^6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell"
"   together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell"
"   together."
"   ^7And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the"
"   herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then"
"   in the land."
"   ^8And Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between"
"   me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we are"
"   brethren."
"   ^9Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee,"
"   from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right;"
"   or if thou wilt depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left."
"   ^10And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that"
"   it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and"
"   Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as"
"   thou comest to Zoar."
"   ^11Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east:"
"   and they separated themselves the one from the other."
"   ^12Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of"
"   the plain, and pitched his tent towards Sodom."
"   ^13But the men of Sodom were wicked, and sinners before the LORD,"
"   exceedingly."
"   ^14And the LORD said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, Lift"

"   and southward, and eastward, and westward:"
"   ^15For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to"

"   ^16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man"

"   ^17Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth"
"   of it; for I will give it to thee."
"   ^18Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of"

"   ^12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and"
"   lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him."
"   ^13And he said to Abram, Know certainly that thy seed shall be a"
"   stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they"
"   shall afflict them four hundred years;"
"   ^14And also that nation which they shall serve, will I judge: and"
"   afterward shall they come out with great substance."
"   ^15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a"
"   good old age."
"   ^16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the"
"   iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full."
"   ^17And it came to pass, that when the sun had gone down, and it was"
"   dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between"
"   those pieces."
"   ^18In that same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To thy"
"   seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great"
"   river, the river Euphrates:"
"   ^19The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,"
"   ^20And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,"
"   ^21And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the"
"   Jebusites."

"   ^1Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no children: and she had a"
"   handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar."
"   ^2And Sarai said to Abram, Behold, now, the LORD hath restrained me"
"   from bearing: I pray thee go in to my maid; it may be that I may obtain"
"   children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai."
"   ^3And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, after"
"   Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her"
"   husband Abram to be his wife."
"   ^4And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she"
"   had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes."
"   ^5And Sarai said to Abram, my wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid"
"   into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised"
"   in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee."
"   ^6But Abram said to Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her"
"   as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled"
"   from her face."
"   ^7And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the"
"   wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur."
"   ^8And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither"
"   wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai."
"   ^9And the angel of the LORD said to her, Return to thy mistress, and"
"   submit thyself under her hands."
"   ^10And the angel of the LORD said to her, I will multiply thy seed"
"   exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude."
"   ^11And the angel of the LORD said to her, Behold, thou art with child,"
"   and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD"
"   hath heard thy affliction."
"   ^12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and"
"   every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all"
"   his brethren."
"   ^13And she called the name of the LORD that spoke to her, Thou God"
"   seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth"
"   me?"
"   ^14Wherefore the well was called Beer-la-hai-roi; behold, it is between"
"   Kadesh and Bered."
"   ^15And Hagar bore Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which"
"   Hagar bore, Ishmael."
"   ^16And Abram was eighty six years old, when Hagar bore Ishmael to"
"   Abram."

"   ^1And when Abram was ninety and nine years old, the LORD appeared to"
"   Abram, and said to him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be"
"   thou perfect."
"   ^2And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply"
"   thee exceedingly."
"   ^3And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,"
"   ^4As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a"
"   father of many nations."
"   ^5Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall"
"   be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee."
"   ^6And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of"
"   thee; and kings shall proceed from thee."
"   ^7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed"
"   after thee, in their generations, for an everlasting covenant; to be a"
"   God to thee and to thy seed after thee."
"   ^8And I will give to thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land in"
"   which thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting"
"   possession; and I will be their God."
"   ^9And God said to Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou,"
"   and thy seed after thee, in their generations."
"   ^10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep between me and you, and thy"
"   seed after thee; Every male-child among you shall be circumcised."
"   ^11And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be"
"   a token of the covenant betwixt me and you."
"   ^12And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every"
"   male-child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought"
"   with money of any stranger, who is not of thy seed."
"   ^13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money,"
"   must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for"
"   an everlasting covenant."
"   ^14And the uncircumcised male-child, whose flesh of his foreskin is not"
"   circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken"
"   my covenant."
"   ^15And God said to Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call"
"   her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be."
"   ^16And I will bless her, and give thee a son also by her: yea, I will"
"   bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall"
"   proceed from her."
"   ^17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart,"
"   Shall a child be born to him that is a hundred years old? and shall"
"   Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear?"
"   ^18And Abraham said to God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!"
"   ^19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou"
"   shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him"
"   for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him."
"   ^20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him,"
"   and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve"
"   princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation."
"   ^21But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear"
"   to thee at this set time in the next year."
"   ^22And he ceased talking with him, and God went up from Abraham."
"   ^23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his"
"   house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the"
"   men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin, in"
"   the same day, as God had said to him."
"   ^24And Abraham was ninety and nine years old, when he was circumcised"
"   in the flesh of his foreskin."
"   ^25And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised"
"   in the flesh of his foreskin."
"   ^26In the same day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son."
"   ^27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with"
"   money of the stranger, were circumcised with him."

"   ^1And the LORD appeared to him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in"
"   the tent door in the heat of the day;"
"   ^2And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and lo, three men stood by him:"
"   and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed"
"   himself toward the ground,"
"   ^3And said, My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not"
"   away, I pray thee, from thy servant:"
"   ^4Let a little water, I pray you, be brought, and wash your feet, and"
"   rest yourselves under the tree:"
"   ^5And I will bring a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after"
"   that you shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And"
"   they said, So do, as thou hast said."
"   ^6And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, Make ready"
"   quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the"
"   hearth."
"   ^7And Abraham ran to the herd, and brought a calf tender and good, and"
"   gave it to a young man; and he hasted to dress it."
"   ^8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and"
"   set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they ate."
"   ^9And they said to him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold,"
"   in the tent."
"   ^10And he said, I will certainly return to thee according to the time"
"   of life; and lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in"
"   the tent door, which was behind him."
"   ^11Now Abraham and Sarah were old and far advanced in age; and it"
"   ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women."
"   ^12Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am become"
"   old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?"
"   ^13And the LORD said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I"
"   certainly bear a child, who am old?"
"   ^14Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will"
"   return to thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a"
"   son."
